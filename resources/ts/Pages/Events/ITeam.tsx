                        iTeam is a new event which intends to encourage those with an interest in producing digital educational resources to teach the bible to work together within a defined project for PBS. It is hoped that each contributor benefits personally in developing their own skillset by working along with complimentary skills while the group as a whole brings a whole year of bible lessons to be "click ready" for the classroom.

                        In accordance with our Child Safety Policy (which applies, since both minors and adults will participate in this week), we have to ask some rather personal questions. These are necessary for legal reasons, and we do trust that you will understand.
