                        <li>The age limit of 10 or over by the 1st January, 2024 will strictly apply. Campers should not be over 17 years old by the end of camp.</li>
                        <li>Places are only available for those who are, and have been, regularly returning PBS lessons for the year 2024</li>
                        <li>Registration may be completed by post, delivery to our office or via the links online. Please do this as soon as possible since priority will be given to those who send their application early.</li>

If you list any more than one, it can make arranging the rooms very difficult. Further details about Holiday Week will be sent to you nearer the time, and you will be sent a receipt for your deposit.</Paragraph>
