At a few times over the years there have been attempts to continue to provide that experience for those who were too old for camp but only as one off events. In the Summer of 2012, as a group of teens left their final year of camp the idea of a weekend together for teens and young adults was reborn. Since January 2013 we have been holding 3 weekend events each year. In the early days it was just 12-20 each weekend but that has now grown to as many as 70. As friends have brought others over the years the group has expanded to reflect an Irish focus with an International flavour. As we moved online during the pandemic past attendees from several countries and continents were able to join in the teaching sessions. In November 2021 we returned to in person events with our largest attendance to date despite a few restrictions."})})]})}),t("section",{className:"px-4 md:pb-8",children:[e(s,{children:"Location"}),t("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-10 mx-auto mt-10 md:flex-row",children:[e("div",{id:"castledaly-location",children:e("iframe",{className:"h-[300px] w-full md:h-[400px] md:w-[600px]",src:"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2380.034969766731!2d-7.80367208441075!3d53.378423780009456!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x485c4c9204f232b9%3A0x142951a650ea93b6!2sCastledaly%20Manor%20-%20BCM%20Ireland!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1674635864862!5m2!1sen!2suk",loading:"lazy",referrerPolicy:"no-referrer-when-downgrade"})}),t("div",{className:"text-left",children:[e("h3",{className:"mb-4 text-lg font-bold",children:"Castledaly Manor"}),e(a,{className:"text-black",children:"STEP takes place at Castledaly Manor which is a Christian Camp and Conference Centre in the heart of Ireland."}),t(a,{className:"text-black",children:["It is owned by ",e(o,{href:"https://bcmireland.ie/",newTab:!0,children:"Bible Centred Ministries (BCM)"})," Ireland, who run camps throughout the year.
